Issue: 

Terraform init works, but terraform plan throw this error

Planning failed. Terraform encountered an error while generating this plan.

Seems to be a token cache issue, however, using az logout gives this error

Solution:

Deleting %USERPROFILE%\.azure resolved the issue. You need to use az login to sign back in, but after that Terraform plan will work


Issue:
Error: Duplicate resource "azurerm_network_interface" configuration

│   on network.tf line 31:
│   31: resource "azurerm_network_interface" "network_interface" {
│
│ A azurerm_network_interface resource named "network_interface" was already declared at network.tf:19,1-57. Resource names   
│ must be unique per type in each module.

Solution:

Changed the name resource name on the duplicate and adjusted the code that called it elsewhere.

Various syntax errors found during plan, but were corrected.

Standard_DS1_v2 was not available in my chosen location, so altered the location to the next region.

The specified disk size 32 GB is smaller than the size of the corresponding disk in the VM image: 64 GB. This is not allowed. Adjusted accordingly.
